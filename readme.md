## Tabot
Discord bot made with Node.js that provides us with our university's latest updates from Facebook.
Used to use web-scraping with puppeteer to get the news from Facebook but Facebook constantly changed to prevent this so we turned to RSS.

### Backstory:
I've wanted to make a bot for fun since a while back, today I made it and it's online 24/7
Some years ago some friends and I were arguing about developing a "Gustavo simulator" inspired by his nonsense since in person it's like a magic conch (Like the one from SpongeBob), you ask him something and he replies something random.
Remembering this story, I developed a "Tabot" which by calling him by his name "Tavo" and some misspelled variations he will reply with some of his "famous sayings".

Thanks to [@piloalucard](https://github.com/piloalucard) for inspiring this project and for all the fun he has given to us through the years!
